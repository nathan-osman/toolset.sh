toolset.sh
==========

Welcome! This site contains a number of utilities for things such as:

- generating random numbers
- generating UUIDs
- looking up the current date / time
- finding your current IP address

These tools are typically used as follows:

http[s]:// toolset.sh / [tool name] ? param1=value

For example, to retrieve the current date and time as a Unix timestamp:

$ curl toolset.sh/time?format=unix
1750704248

By default, curl clients get text/plain responses. If you want the response in a different format, just specify a custom Accept: header in your request:

$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" toolset.sh/time?format=unix
{"value":"1750704248"}
